# SmoothSlopes
A better strict slopes mod for Cities: Skylines

[Stricter slope limits](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=413311572) is a great mod by Japa which limits the maximum slope for depending on network type. The maximum slope for regular roads is decreased from 25% to 15%, but the maximum slope for trains is only 5%. This adds a challenge and makes the cities look more realistic.

This mod does exactly the same, with three important new features:

  * The mod distinguishes highway ramps from highways and allows different slope limits from both road types.
  * The mod uses a config file to determine the maximum slope limits, so these values can be changed by the user. The config file is called SmoothSlopesConfig.xml and is stored in (Steam dir)\steamapps\common\Cities_Skylines
  * The mod uses two sets of limits: strict and relaxed. If a user runs into a problem using the strict limits, he can temporarily switch to the relaxed limits. By default this is done by holding the LEFT SHIFT key. The mod also supports toggling and/or changing the key used to switch limits.

Many thanks to the authors of the [stricter slope limits mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=413311572) and the  [HideUI mod](https://github.com/AlexanderDzhoganov/Skylines-HideUI). I have learned a lot by looking at their code.
