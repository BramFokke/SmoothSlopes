# SmoothSlopes
A better strict slopes mod for Cities: Skylines

[Stricter slope limits](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=413311572) is a great mod by Japa which limits the maximum slope for depending on network type. The maximum slope for regular roads is decreased from 25% to 15%, but the maximum slope for trains is only 5%. This adds a challenge and makes the cities look more realistic.

This mod does exactly the same, with two important new features:

  * The mod uses a config file to determine the maximum slope limits, so these values can be changed by the user.
  * The user can hold <shift> to temporarily relax the slope limit for when the user is in a tight spot.
